                Welcome to FoodPizza! We are a family-owned and operated pizza restaurant that has been serving delicious, hand-crafted pizzas for over 20 years. Our mission is to provide our customers with high-quality, flavorful pizzas that are made with fresh ingredients and baked to perfection.<br>

Our story began in 2004 when our founder, Mansour, decided to start his own pizza restaurant. With a passion for cooking and a commitment to quality, he set out to create a pizza that was unlike any other. He spent countless hours experimenting with different doughs, sauces, and toppings until he finally found the perfect recipe. Today, Mansour's legacy lives on through the FoodPizza brand, which is now known for its mouth-watering pizzas and exceptional customer service.<br>

At FoodPizza, we believe that pizza should be more than just a meal - it should be an experience. That's why we take great pride in every pizza that we make, using only the freshest and highest-quality ingredients. Whether you're in the mood for a classic pepperoni pizza or something a little more adventurous, like our signature Mediterranean pizza, we have something for everyone.<br>

Our team is made up of experienced pizza makers and friendly staff who are dedicated to providing the best possible customer service. We believe that great food and great service go hand in hand, and we strive to make every visit to our restaurant a memorable one. <br>

In addition to our commitment to quality and customer service, we are also committed to giving back to the community. We are proud to support local charities and organizations that make a positive impact in our community.<br>

Thank you for considering FoodPizza for your next meal. We look forward to serving you soon!
